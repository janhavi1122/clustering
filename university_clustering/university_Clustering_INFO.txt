This program applies Hierarchical and K-Means clustering techniques on a university dataset to categorize universities based on various features like acceptance ratio, faculty ratio, and expenses. It first preprocesses the data by normalizing it, then uses AgglomerativeClustering to create a hierarchical clustering dendrogram and KMeans to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results are saved in CSV files for further analysis. Visualization of the clustering process is also included.
