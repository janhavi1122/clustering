This script analyzes US crime data to uncover patterns across variables like Murder, Rape, Assault, and UrbanPop. After exploring and ensuring data integrity, key features are standardized using StandardScaler to prepare for hierarchical clustering, visualized through a dendrogram. Various plots, including bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, PDFs, and CDFs, provide deeper insights into crime rates and their distributions across states, enhancing understanding through descriptive and inferential visualizations.
