This program performs hierarchical clustering on a dataset of universities to identify patterns and group them into clusters based on various features. The dataset is preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns (like "State") and normalizing the data. The Agglomerative Clustering algorithm is used with the complete linkage method and Euclidean distance to form 3 clusters. A dendrogram is plotted to visualize the clustering process, and cluster labels are assigned to each university. The results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis, showing the average values for each feature in each cluster.
